# Solute Solubility Datasets in ScCOâ‚‚

This repository contains datasets of solubility data of solutes in supercritical COâ‚‚ (ScCOâ‚‚). The datasets are compiled from multiple published studies and include anthraquinone derivatives (AQDs) and drug-like compounds (Drugs), aiming to facilitate research in data-driven solubility modeling.

## Dataset Overview

- **AQD Dataset**: Includes solubility data of 28 anthraquinone derivatives in ScCOâ‚‚.
- **Drug Dataset**: Includes solubility data of 96 drug-like compounds in ScCOâ‚‚.
- **Features**:
  - **SMILES**: Canonical SMILES representation of each solute.
  - **Readout**: The readout vector obtained from the MPNN model during sigma profile prediction.
  - **Temperature (K)**: Experimental temperature condition in Kelvin.
  - **Pressure (MPa)**: Experimental pressure condition in Megapascal.
  - **LOG(y)**: Logarithmic solubility value of the solute in ScCOâ‚‚.

## Example Data Format

| SMILES                  | Readout                 | Temperature (K) | Pressure (MPa) | LOG(y) |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| C1=CC=C2C(=O)C=CC(=O)C2=C1 | [0.23, -0.45, 0.89, ...] | 313.15        | 10.0         | -5.21   |
| C1=CC=C(C=C1)C=O        | [0.12, -0.34, 0.76, ...] | 323.15        | 12.5         | -4.85   |

- **Readout Vector**: The readout vector is a 200-dimensional molecular representation, learned from the MPNN model during sigma profile prediction. It captures the structural and physicochemical features of the molecule.

## Usage

To use the dataset, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuchiaochu/Solubility_data.git
```
Then, load the dataset in Python using pandas:
```python
import pandas as pd

aqd_df = pd.read_csv("dataset/28AQD_dataset.csv")
drug_df = pd.read_csv("dataset/96Drug_dataset.csv")

print(aqd_df.head())
print(drug_df.head())
```
